      intro: "Stretching is often overlooked in fitness routines, yet it's one of the most crucial components of a well-rounded training program. Whether you're a seasoned athlete or just beginning your fitness journey, incorporating proper stretching can dramatically improve your performance and reduce injury risk.",

        {
          heading: 'Why Stretching Matters',
          paragraphs: [
            'Dynamic stretching before workouts prepares your muscles for activity by increasing blood flow and range of motion. This activation helps prevent strains and improves overall performance during your training session.',
            'Static stretching after exercise aids in recovery by reducing muscle tension and promoting flexibility. This is crucial for maintaining long-term mobility and preventing the stiffness that often follows intense workouts.',
          ],

        {
          heading: 'Types of Stretching',
          paragraphs: [
            'Dynamic stretching involves active movements that take joints through their full range of motion. Examples include leg swings, arm circles, and walking lunges. These are perfect for warming up before strength training or cardio sessions.',
            'Static stretching involves holding a position for 15-30 seconds to lengthen muscles. This type is best performed after workouts when muscles are warm, helping to improve overall flexibility and reduce post-workout soreness.',
          ],

        {
          heading: 'Building a Stretching Routine',
          paragraphs: [
            'Start with 5-10 minutes of dynamic stretching before your workout. Focus on the muscle groups you\'ll be using during your session. For leg day, include hip circles, leg swings, and walking lunges.',
            'After your workout, dedicate 10-15 minutes to static stretching. Hold each stretch for at least 20-30 seconds without bouncing. Remember to breathe deeply and never push to the point of pain.',
          ],
        },
      ],
      conclusion: "Making stretching a non-negotiable part of your fitness routine will pay dividends in improved performance, reduced injury risk, and better overall mobility.

            'If you\'re training early or need a quick snack 30-60 minutes before your workout, opt for easily digestible options like a banana with almond butter, Greek yogurt with berries, or a small smoothie. These provide quick energy without weighing you down.',

            'After training, replace fluids lost through sweat. A good rule of thumb is to drink 16-24 ounces of water for every pound lost during exercise. For sessions over 90 minutes, consider adding electrolytes to support optimal recovery.',

      conclusion: "Proper nutrition timing is a powerful tool for maximizing your fitness results. By fueling your body correctly before and after workouts, you'll enhance performance, speed recovery, and make consistent progress toward your goals.
